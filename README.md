# ***Fantasy College Basketball*** 🏀
## About 📘
Group project for Software Engineering (CSC 4700) at Villanova University. This is a semester long project that has helped our group learn and apply concepts seen in the agile methodology and the software development life cycle (SDLC). This project in particular is also coupled with a semester long project in Villanova's Principles of Database Systems (CSC 4480) as we've learned how to build and manage a database while connecting it to this project.
## Motivation 🧠
Each October, 12 million individuals across North America eagerly carve an hour out of their busy schedules to join in fantasy NBA drafts. These drafts unite friends, coworkers, family members, and even strangers in a 6-month long competition that pushes their basketball knowledge to its limit. Users participate in a league that allows them to assemble a team using players from different real-life teams, and then pit their fantasy team against those of their league competitors. Despite the massive market for fantasy sports, there is a huge vacuum when it comes to college basketball. Our team has set out to fill this need with our fantasy college basketball app. The app pairs React Native with a college basketball API to produce the traditional fantasy experience with live player stats. With just a few clicks, users can join leagues, draft their rosters, adjust their starting lineups, add and drop players to waivers, view their weekly matchup, and more. Additionally, users can create their own league as a league manager.  League managers all have the same abilities as the typical league member, on top of being able to schedule drafts and customize league settings to enhance the experience for everyone. Enjoying the app is as simple as downloading it to your mobile phone from the app store, signing up for an account, and joining or creating a league. Join us today and bring the thrills of fantasy sports to college basketball!
