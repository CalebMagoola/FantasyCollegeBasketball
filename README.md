## Summary
Group project for Software Engineering (CSC 4700) at Villanova University. This is a semester long project that has helped our group learn and apply concepts seen in the agile methodology and the software development life cycle (SDLC). This project in particular is also coupled with a semester long project in Villanova's Principles of Database Systems (CSC 4480) as we've learned how to build and manage a database while connecting it to this project.
